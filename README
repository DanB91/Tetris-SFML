This is a simple Tetris clone written in C++11 with the SFML library.

Note: It does not currently have sound.

Requirements:
    -SFML
    -CMake
    -Compiler that supports C++11 (was compiled using clang on my machine).

To Build:
    1) Clone repo
    2) Create a build directory inside of the repo (e.g. "mkdir build")
    3) Go to the build directory (e.g. "cd build")
    4) cmake ..
    5) make
    6) ./Tetris
    7) Enjoy!

Controls:

X - Rotate clockwise
Z - Rotate counter-clockwise
Left, Right and Down arrow keys - Move left, right and down one space
Spacebar - drop piece

TODO:

- Implement sound!
- Allow different resolutions
- Perhaps implement animations when blocks dissapear
