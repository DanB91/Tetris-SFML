This is a simple Tetris clone written in C++11 with the SFML library.

Note: It does not currently have sound.

Requirements:
    -SFML 2.0
    -CMake
    -Compiler that supports C++11 (was compiled using clang on my machine).

To Build:
    1) Clone repo
    2) Create a build directory inside of the repo (e.g. "mkdir build")
    3) Go to the build directory (e.g. "cd build")
    4) cmake ..
    5) make
    6) ./Tetris
    7) Enjoy!

Controls:
    X - Rotate clockwise
    Z - Rotate counter-clockwise
    Left, Right and Down arrow keys - Move left, right and down one space
    Spacebar - drop piece

Usage:
 ./Tetris [resource_dir]

 resource_dir: 
    The directory where the resources (including images and fonts) are located
    If unspecifed, resource_dir defaults to "../res".            

TODO:

- Implement sound!
- Allow different resolutions
- Perhaps implement animations when blocks dissapear
